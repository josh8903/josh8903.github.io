### Welcome to my Git page!
This is a work in progress. I will be continually updating this web page as I learn new things and expand my portfolio. I hope you will take a moment to check out my work!

### Future development
* Create portfolio page instead of linking github
* Create resume page, provide PDF download
* Enhance layout for mobile usability
